   Typical bottlenecks of programs in R are (1) loops that can not easily be vectorized, because calculations in a given iteration depend on the results from the previous iterations; (2) recursive functions or problems that require multiple calling the same function. C++ can help to solve these problems. It is a modern, fast and very well supported programming language with numerous additional libraries allowing to perform various types of computational tasks. <br><br>

Thanks to the Rcpp package written by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois combining C++ with R is very easy. Various aspects of C++ and Rcpp will be discussed starting from simple examples that will help you easily replace the R code with often significantly faster counterparts in C++. <br><br>

An earlier knowledge of C++ is NOT required, but it will probably be helpful.

The use of C++ in R requires installation of a C++ compiler.

To make it available, please:
- on Windows: install the latest version of Rtools.
- on Mac: install the Xcode application from the AppStore
- on Linux: sudo apt-get install r-base-dev or similar.

Workshop participants are kindly requested to install the newest version of Rtools (or equivalent - see above) and Rcpp package on their computers BEFORE the workshop

Prior to the installation of above packages it is also recommended:
install.packages(c("devtools", "usethis", "installr", "Rcpp", "RcppArmadillo", "RcppNumerical", "rbenchmark"))
