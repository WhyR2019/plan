  Special Interest Groups <br><br>
On the 27th of September we organize meetings of Special Interest Groups,
where participants of WhyR 2019 can discuss their experiences in three specific areas:

Diversity in Data Science
This board aims to inspire members of affinity groups to pursue careers in data science. We hope that this platform for networking will reduce the diversity of R community.

Career-planning in Data Science
Participants of WhyR will have a chance to learn from more experienced R enthusiasts about their career paths.

Teaching Data Science
Practitioners will share their experiences in introducing their students to basic and advanced concepts of data science.

Data Visualizations
Discuss data visualizations good practices and approaches to various presentation challenges.

Ethics in Data Science
With the increased importance of machine learning, we are becoming more and more concerned about the ethics of data science.
